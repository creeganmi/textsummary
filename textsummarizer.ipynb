    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization is a common problem in the 21st century as the world has become increasingly driven by data. Summarization of data can be very useful to  quickly determine if something is relevant or whether it's worth reading. Another use case could could be to store summaries of articles it in the backend to run downstream taks on. It could also be useful to understand the semantic integrity to indicate quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this topic, we will leverage the extreme summarization dataset (XSUM) which consists of BBC articles accompanying single sentence summaries. Each article is prefaced with an introductory sentence (which is a summary) that is professionally written, typically by the author of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize articles, we will use an encoder-decoder transformer (sequence-to-sequence) which combines  decoders and encoders because we need to perform both input and output tasks: taking in text and then generating a summary. We selected this type of transformer because the encoder accepts inputs (text) and computes a high level representation of those inputs  which are then passed to the decoder to generate a prediction output (summary). This has advantages over using a standalone encoder like BERT/ALBERT/ELECTRA/RoBERTA/DistilBERT to name a few because  encoders are pre-trained by filling randomly masked words in sentences and therefore are better suited for output tasks. Using a standalone decoder like gpt2 would also not be optimal because decoders are trained to guess the next word in a sequence (left or right context aka does not have context on one side of the sequence) and therefore are better suited at generating text but not necessarily taking in text because of the hidden context limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our scoring will compare the output of the BART encoder-decoder model to the professionally written summaries in the XSUM dataset to see how similar a machine generated summary is to a professional one. Our scoring methodology will be focused on semantic textual similarity and computed using the cosine similarity between the professional human written summary and the machine generated one. "

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",

He sees his current proposals as well-balanced, and endorsed by the electorate last May.\\nAnd with a deal with Labour or the Tories more or less dismissed in advance on political grounds, that leaves Mr Rennie as the clear favourite.\\nHe may well have beefed up his demands accordingly - minus any red lines, of course, over tax.\\nThere are plenty of talks still to come, but there is also plenty common ground here.

       "      <td>On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at North Middlesex University Hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&amp;E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. \"There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added Tottenham MP David Lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than I feared\" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement. The trust is now required to improve the care of patients in the emergency department by 26 August 2016 following a warning from the CQC. A full inspection of the trust will take place in September.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Golden Rice\" has been developed by scientists to combat vitamin A deficiency, which affects millions of children in the developing world. The crop was just weeks away from being submitted to the authorities for a safety evaluation. But a group of around 400 protestors attacked the field trial in the Bicol region and uprooted all the GM plants. The project to develop Golden Rice was started 20 years ago in 1993 by German researchers with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice has been modified by adding extra genes that turn on the plant's ability to produce beta-carotene, which humans can convert into vitamin A. A lack of this vitamin increases the chances of blindness and susceptibility to disease. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant problem among children in developing countries. According to Helen Keller International, around 670,000 children will die each year from the problem, while 350,000 will go blind. It is estimated that one cup of Golden Rice could provide half an adult's recommended daily intake. Golden Rice field trials are currently being carried out in the Philippines under the auspices of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with PhilRice, the local research body. Five small test plots have been planted with the idea that there would shortly be a submission to the regulatory authority of the Philippines. It was hoped that initial releases to farmers could happen in 2014. The plot in Bicol was guarded and fenced but the protestors broke through the security and uprooted and trampled the rice plants. The attackers who were members of a group called Sikwal-Gmo say they attacked the crop because they believe that GM technology is not the solution to malnutrition in the Philippines. The protestors argue that international agrochemical corporations and the US are behind the drive for Golden Rice. In a statement, they said they were concerned that the rice trial was both a danger to human health and biodiversity. The scientists involved with the trial say they were relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. \"It was not completely unexpected as we had heard threats,\" the IRRI's Dr Bruce Tolentino told BBC News. \"It was certainly disappointing to have our field trial vandalised because our Golden Rice research aims to avoid the horrible plight of women and children suffering vitamin A deficiency.\" The researchers say that the development of the modified rice remains critical for the Philippines as 1.7 million children in the country aged under five are affected by vitamin A deficiency. They say they are determined to go ahead with the project. \"This is not a major setback, because it is just one trial of a series and just one of several sites. We remain completely committed to continuing our Golden Rice research to help improve people's nutrition,\" said Dr Tolentino. The development of GM technology is highly contentious in the Philippines. Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals rejected another crop, an eggplant that had been modified to produce toxins to a pest. The court ruled that the crop violated the constitutional rights of Filipinos to health and a balanced ecology. Follow Matt on Twitter.</td>\n",

       "      <td>At least a dozen Republicans have said they will not be voting for him, since the comments emerged on Friday. Mr Trump says he will never drop out of the race to be president and will never let his supporters down. He has been under pressure after a tape from 2005 of him bragging about groping and kissing women was broadcast. The latest to withdraw their support are former Republican presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Mr McCain said Mr Trump's comments \"make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy\", while Ms Rice said: \"Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.\" New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said in a statement: \"I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\" she said Ms Ayotte - who faces a competitive race for re-election - said she would not vote for Mrs Clinton but instead would \"write in\" Mike Pence, Mr Trump's vice-presidential running mate, on her ballot paper. Several other Republicans also said they would vote for Mr Pence. Mr Trump himself stressed that there was \"zero chance I'll quit\", adding that he was getting \"unbelievable\" support. And in a tweet, the Republican candidate said \"the media and establishment want me out of the race so badly\". Mr Trump's wife Melania issued a statement on Saturday saying: \"The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.\" She said her husband had \"the heart and mind of a leader\". Mr Pence said he was \"offended\" by Mr Trump's video, but grateful he had expressed remorse and apologised to the American people. \"We pray for his family,\" he said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan had originally invited Mr Trump to attend a campaign event in Wisconsin this weekend but rescinded his invitation, saying he was \"sickened\" by what he had heard. Mr Pence was due to go in his running mate's place, but declined to attend. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's Democratic election rival, called his comments in the tape \"horrific\". In the recorded comments, which date back to 2005 when Mr Trump was appearing as a guest on a soap, he says \"you can do anything\" to women \"when you're a star\" and is heard saying \"grab them by the pussy\". The candidate released a video statement apologising for the comments. Mr Trump's 2005 comments, posted by the Washington Post, overshadowed the release of transcripts of Mrs Clinton's speeches to private events, by the whistle-blowing site Wikileaks. The candidate had married his third wife Melania a few months before the recording. She said on Saturday: \"I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.\" Who is ahead in the polls? 49% Hillary Clinton 45% Donald Trump Last updated October 3, 2016 The second TV debate between Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take place on Sunday evening in St Louis. Mr Trump recently said he would not bring up stories about Bill Clinton's infidelities in the debate, after previously threatening to do so. But in his video apology, he attacked the former president directly: \"Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked and shamed his victims. \"We'll discuss this in the coming days,\" he said. \"See you at the debate on Sunday.\" The day after a video emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because he's a star and so could just grab them by the pussy, Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water. Enough, quite possibly, to sink any chance he had of winning the White House. There is a violence in the phrases \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and \"you can do anything\" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening. But this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party. It has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen. Read more from Katty</td>\n",

With England seamer Chris Woakes conceding 47 from seven wicketless overs, it was Warwickshire's spinners who undermined the Essex run chase after openers Westley and Nick Browne put on 75 in 12 overs, claiming eight wickets between them. Browne was stumped off Ateeq Javid and Jesse Ryder, Jaik Mickleburgh and Zaidi were all guilty of poor shots as numbers three to six in the order all failed to reach double figures. Essex slumped to 134-6 in the 28th over, with leg-spinner Josh Poysden claiming 3-46, and it was Jeetan Patel (3-32) who ended the game by having ten Doeschate lbw after he reached a run-a-ball half-century. Earlier Trott, who now averages 77.80 in this season's competition, anchored the Warwickshire innings after skipper Ian Bell was caught behind for a fourth-ball duck. He shared a stand of 136 with Tim Ambrose (60) and although his dismissal sparked a mini-slump from 227-3 to 257-7, Evans hit three sixes and three fours to boost the total in the closing overs.</td>\n",

Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&amp;E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. \"There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014.

He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement.

The crop was just weeks away from being submitted to the authorities for a safety evaluation. But a group of around 400 protestors attacked the field trial in the Bicol region and uprooted all the GM plants. The project to develop Golden Rice was started 20 years ago in 1993 by German researchers with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice has been modified by adding extra genes that turn on the plant's ability to produce beta-carotene, which humans can convert into vitamin A. A lack of this vitamin increases the chances of blindness and susceptibility to disease. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant problem among children in developing countries. According to Helen Keller International, around 670,000 children will die each year from the problem, while 350,000 will go blind. It is estimated that one cup of Golden Rice could provide half an adult's recommended daily intake. Golden Rice field trials are currently being carried out in the Philippines under the auspices of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with PhilRice, the local research body. Five small test plots have been planted with the idea that there would shortly be a submission to the regulatory authority of the Philippines. It was hoped that initial releases to farmers could happen in 2014. The plot in Bicol was guarded and fenced but the protestors broke through the security and uprooted and trampled the rice plants. The attackers who were members of a group called Sikwal-Gmo say they attacked the crop because they believe that GM technology is not the solution to malnutrition in the Philippines. The protestors argue that international agrochemical corporations and the US are behind the drive for Golden Rice. In a statement, they said they were concerned that the rice trial was both a danger to human health and biodiversity. The scientists involved with the trial say they were relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. \"It was not completely unexpected as we had heard threats,\" the IRRI's Dr Bruce Tolentino told BBC News. \"It was certainly disappointing to have our field trial vandalised because our Golden Rice research aims to avoid the horrible plight of women and children suffering vitamin A deficiency.\" The researchers say that the development of the modified rice remains critical for the Philippines as 1.7 million children in the country aged under five are affected by vitamin A deficiency. They say they are determined to go ahead with the project. \"This is not a major setback, because it is just one trial of a series and just one of several sites. We remain completely committed to continuing our Golden Rice research to help improve people's nutrition,\" said Dr Tolentino. The development of GM technology is highly contentious in the Philippines. Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals rejected another crop, an eggplant that had been modified to produce toxins to a pest. The court ruled that the crop violated the constitutional rights of Filipinos to health and a balanced ecology. Follow Matt on Twitter.</td>\n",

Mr Trump says he will never drop out of the race to be president and will never let his supporters down. He has been under pressure after a tape from 2005 of him bragging about groping and kissing women was broadcast. The latest to withdraw their support are former Republican presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Mr McCain said Mr Trump's comments \"make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy\", while Ms Rice said: \"Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.\" New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said in a statement: \"I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\" she said Ms Ayotte - who faces a competitive race for re-election - said she would not vote for Mrs Clinton but instead would \"write in\" Mike Pence, Mr Trump's vice-presidential running mate, on her ballot paper. Several other Republicans also said they would vote for Mr Pence. Mr Trump himself stressed that there was \"zero chance I'll quit\", adding that he was getting \"unbelievable\" support. And in a tweet, the Republican candidate said \"the media and establishment want me out of the race so badly\". Mr Trump's wife Melania issued a statement on Saturday saying: \"The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.\" She said her husband had \"the heart and mind of a leader\". Mr Pence said he was \"offended\" by Mr Trump's video, but grateful he had expressed remorse and apologised to the American people. \"We pray for his family,\" he said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan had originally invited Mr Trump to attend a campaign event in Wisconsin this weekend but rescinded his invitation, saying he was \"sickened\" by what he had heard. Mr Pence was due to go in his running mate's place, but declined to attend. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's Democratic election rival, called his comments in the tape \"horrific\". In the recorded comments, which date back to 2005 when Mr Trump was appearing as a guest on a soap, he says \"you can do anything\" to women \"when you're a star\" and is heard saying \"grab them by the pussy\". The candidate released a video statement apologising for the comments. Mr Trump's 2005 comments, posted by the Washington Post, overshadowed the release of transcripts of Mrs Clinton's speeches to private events, by the whistle-blowing site Wikileaks. The candidate had married his third wife Melania a few months before the recording. She said on Saturday: \"I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.\" Who is ahead in the polls? 49% Hillary Clinton 45% Donald Trump Last updated October 3, 2016 The second TV debate between Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take place on Sunday evening in St Louis. Mr Trump recently said he would not bring up stories about Bill Clinton's infidelities in the debate, after previously threatening to do so. But in his video apology, he attacked the former president directly: \"Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked and shamed his victims. \"We'll discuss this in the coming days,\" he said. \"See you at the debate on Sunday.\" The day after a video emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because he's a star and so could just grab them by the pussy, Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water. Enough, quite possibly, to sink any chance he had of winning the White House. There is a violence in the phrases \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and \"you can do anything\" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.

Tom Westley made 61 for Essex and Ryan ten Doeschate was last to go for 50 as they were all out for 213. It was a disappointing batting effort which left 7.5 overs unused, and Warwickshire will now be at home to Somerset - who beat Worcestershire by nine wickets - on 28 or 29 August, with a place in the Lord's final at stake. With England seamer Chris Woakes conceding 47 from seven wicketless overs, it was Warwickshire's spinners who undermined the Essex run chase after openers Westley and Nick Browne put on 75 in 12 overs, claiming eight wickets between them. Browne was stumped off Ateeq Javid and Jesse Ryder, Jaik Mickleburgh and Zaidi were all guilty of poor shots as numbers three to six in the order all failed to reach double figures. Essex slumped to 134-6 in the 28th over, with leg-spinner Josh Poysden claiming 3-46, and it was Jeetan Patel (3-32) who ended the game by having ten Doeschate lbw after he reached a run-a-ball half-century. Earlier Trott, who now averages 77.80 in this season's competition, anchored the Warwickshire innings after skipper Ian Bell was caught behind for a fourth-ball duck. He shared a stand of 136 with Tim Ambrose (60) and although his dismissal sparked a mini-slump from 227-3 to 257-7, Evans hit three sixes and three fours to boost the total in the closing overs.</td>\n",

    "# Preparing XSUM Data\n",
    "Before we can put the text into a model we need to convert it into a format that the transformer can understand. Encoders and decoders only understand numerical values; we need to tokenize each word and then convert the tokens into numerical values. The tokenization transformer splits text into tokens and then adds special tokens if expected based on pretraining. The tokenizer then matches each token to unique id in vocabulary of tokenizer which has a corresponding vector of numerical values. These vectors contain the contextualized value of a word. For example, the vector representation of the word \"to\" isnt just \"to\", it also takes into account the words around it which are called context (right and left context). To continue this example, \"Welcome to NYC\" is a sentence that has the word \"to\". For the word \"to\" the left context is \"Welcome\" and the right context is \"NYC\". The output is based on these contexts; this is how the value is a contextualized vector thanks to self-attention mechanism. We can do all of this using the AutoTokenizer.from_pretarined method to ensure that we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use (facebook/bart-large-cnn); however, we will specifically reference the BartTokenizer in our checkpoint, tokenizer, and model to ensure all aspects of our model were trained using the same methodologies so we can avoid unexpected summaries"

The Z10 handset is seen as crucial to the future of Blackberry, which has struggled to keep up with new Apple and Android phones. It has been on sale for a month in the UK, Canada and other markets. It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago.

The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago.

The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago. In total, Blackberry said it had shipped a total of about six million handsets in the three months to early March.</td>\n",

The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago. In total, Blackberry said it had shipped a total of about six million handsets in the three months to early March.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The University of London's Institute of Education compared vocabulary test scores and reading habits of 9,400 British people born in 1970. The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago. In total, Blackberry said it had shipped a total of about six million handsets in the three months to early March.</td>\n",

Lufthansa escaped a sanction after providing information to the Commission. The court said that the European Commission had not been clear enough in demonstrating an unambiguous \"single and continuous infringement\" by the carriers. Instead, the Commission had found four infringements which it had attributed directly to the carriers on particular routes, the court said. \"Internal inconsistencies\" in the decision could infringe the airline's rights of defence, the court added.

       "      <td>The University of London's Institute of Education compared vocabulary test scores and reading habits of 9,400 British people born in 1970. The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

It went on sale with little fanfare a week ago in the United States, Blackberry's most important market. The latest figures do not include US sales. Blackberry was previously called Research In Motion, but changed its name last year. Analysts greeted the results cautiously, saying that it was too early to judge the success of the Z10 and its sister device the Q10. Earlier in the week, Blackberry shares were hit when two major US brokerages expressed disappointment with the US launch of the Z10. In a note to its clients, Citigroup described the launch as \"a big disappointment\". The Blackberry results also showed the company lost three million users over the year. Its handsets are now used by 76 million people, down from 79 million 12 months ago. In total, Blackberry said it had shipped a total of about six million handsets in the three months to early March.</td>\n",

Lufthansa escaped a sanction after providing information to the Commission. The court said that the European Commission had not been clear enough in demonstrating an unambiguous \"single and continuous infringement\" by the carriers. Instead, the Commission had found four infringements which it had attributed directly to the carriers on particular routes, the court said. \"Internal inconsistencies\" in the decision could infringe the airline's rights of defence, the court added.

       "      <td>The University of London's Institute of Education compared vocabulary test scores and reading habits of 9,400 British people born in 1970. The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. \"In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from.\" But they also found \"what people read mattered as how often they read\". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But \"tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers\". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed \"the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16\". The report also said: \"Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers.\" The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred \"highbrow\" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.</td>\n",

He said the phrase appears in three witness statements which was \"clear evidence\" statements have been coached. \"It's a scary thing, why would I intentionally scare a patient, that you've got a time bomb?\" he said. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country The 59-year-old also said one patient, John Ingram, who had a double mastectomy after tests showed only potentially abnormal cells, was a \"quivering mass of anxiety\", convinced he would get cancer. Nothing he told him would have changed his mind, Mr Paterson said. Mr Ingram gave evidence saying Mr Paterson, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, told him in 2006 he was \"on the road to developing breast cancer\". But Mr Paterson, of Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said on Wednesday that Mr Ingram's memory had become \"confused\" over time. He described his patient as a \"troubled gentleman with multiple phobias - one of them breast cancer, because his mother had died of breast cancer, aged 42\". \"So the minute he had an abnormality in his chest wall, in his head he was on the way to getting breast cancer,\" he said. \"Very little I told him thereafter would disavow him of that view.\" Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC asked whether it was \"quite wrong\" to say he would \"travel in time towards cancer\". Mr Paterson said: \"I doubt I said that, simply because nobody has a crystal ball.\" The trial continues.</td>\n",

       " 'Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There\\'s a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.']"
