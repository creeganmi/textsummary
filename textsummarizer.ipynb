    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization is a common problem in the 21st century as the world has become increasingly driven by data. Summarization of data can be very useful to  quickly determine if something is relevant or whether it's worth reading. Another use case could could be to store summaries of articles it in the backend to run downstream taks on. It could also be useful to understand the semantic integrity to indicate quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this topic, we will leverage the extreme summarization dataset (XSUM) which consists of BBC articles accompanying single sentence summaries. Each article is prefaced with an introductory sentence (which is a summary) that is professionally written, typically by the author of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize articles, we will use an encoder-decoder transformer (sequence-to-sequence) which combines  decoders and encoders because we need to perform both input and output tasks: taking in text and then generating a summary. We selected this type of transformer because the encoder accepts inputs (text) and computes a high level representation of those inputs  which are then passed to the decoder to generate a prediction output (summary). This has advantages over using a standalone encoder like BERT/ALBERT/ELECTRA/RoBERTA/DistilBERT to name a few because  encoders are pre-trained by filling randomly masked words in sentences and therefore are better suited for output tasks. Using a standalone decoder like gpt2 would also not be optimal because decoders are trained to guess the next word in a sequence (left or right context aka does not have context on one side of the sequence) and therefore are better suited at generating text but not necessarily taking in text because of the hidden context limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our scoring will compare the output of the BART encoder-decoder model to the professionally written summaries in the XSUM dataset to see how similar a machine generated summary is to a professional one. Our scoring methodology will be focused on semantic textual similarity and computed using the cosine similarity between the professional human written summary and the machine generated one. "

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",

       "      <td>The London borough is the UK local authority with the highest rate of HIV. Local councils and charities warn HIV test guidelines may not be implemented in England because of a lack of funds. New guidance from the National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence aims to increase testing in people with undiagnosed HIV in England. The guidance is published to coincide with World Aids Day. It is estimated that 103,700 people are living with HIV in the UK and 17% of people with the virus are unaware of their infection, so risk unintentionally passing it on to their sexual partners. Part of the new NICE guidance focuses on testing for HIV, which is the responsibility of local authorities, where there are high or extremely high rates of HIV. Two-thirds of late HIV diagnoses occur in these areas. Over one-third of the 152 council areas have high rates. The updated guidance recommends all patients in areas with high and extremely high rates of HIV be offered a test on admission to hospital, if they have not previously been diagnosed with HIV and are undergoing a blood test for another reason. In extremely high rate areas, hospitals should offer the tests even if they are not having blood tests as part of their care. GP surgeries in high and extremely high-rate areas should also offer patients an HIV test on registration. NICE also recommends testing community settings in these high rates areas, such as pharmacies, the voluntary sector and venues where there may be high-risk sexual behaviour. HIV experts have strongly welcomed the new guidance but told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they are concerned the NICE guidance may not be implemented because of a lack of funds. Dr Chloe Orkin, from the British HIV Association, said prevention was simply not \"high\" enough on the government's agenda given pubic health budgets are being cut by nearly 4% a year. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said achieving what NICE was asking was going to be difficult. \"The strain placed on councils by the cuts by central government to public health budgets would make commissioning HIV testing in all surgeries and hospitals in high and extremely high-risk areas an unaffordable burden. \"Despite these limited resources, testing those in high-risk areas must always be a priority. Councils are commissioning HIV testing in a variety of settings.\" But the Department of Health maintained councils had been provided with sufficient funding. Nonetheless, the Elton John Aids Foundation feels councils need help and has offered to fund HIV testing in Lambeth for two years. David Furnish, chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation, said: \"I believe everyone should have an HIV test. We know we can make a difference in Lambeth, but there is no reason why we can't do this in future in other high-rate areas.\" Jennifer Reiter, of Lambeth Council, added: \"We value Elton John Aids Foundation's support and are exploring ways with them to increase access to HIV testing.\" The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays from 09:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Writing in PLOS ONE they say the gene fault may encourage the formation of blood clots - the ultimate cause of most heart attacks and strokes. Scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pinpoint individuals more likely to suffer these conditions. But experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk. Around one in 10 people in the Caucasian population carries this variation of the gene, named PIA2. And researchers from King's College London reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50,000 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date. They found individuals with PIA2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood clot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene. Scientists calculate the gene increases a person's risk of having a stroke by 10-15%. But how significant this increase is depends on an individual's baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking, diet, weight and exercise, the scientists say. And for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70% from this baseline. In a second study published in the same journal, the scientists show PIA2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45. More research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population, they say. About 150,000 people have a stroke in the UK each year and more than 100,000 heart attacks are recorded annually. Both thrombotic strokes (the most common kind) and heart attacks are caused by blockage of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of clots. The faulty gene appears to affect a protein called glycoprotein IIIa - present on platelets, natural clotting cells in the blood. Platelets help trigger the formation of clots to stop bleeding after injury. But scientists say carrying the gene may render them overactive. They caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors, such as high blood pressure and obesity. But developing a genetic test could help predict people at highest risk, allowing doctors to suggest more potent medication or lifestyle changes, they say. Prof Albert Ferro, of King's College London, who led the research, told the BBC: \"We would now need to validate this test and see how useful it is in the clinical world.\" Dr Shamim Quadir, of the Stroke Association, said: \"These latest results are an important step forward in stroke research. \"We hope the findings from this study could lead to many more people who are most at risk of this devastating condition being identified. \"However, if you have a family history of stroke or have any other risk factors, this does not mean the condition is inevitable. Regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking can be important steps to significantly reduce your stroke risk.\" Prof Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: \"It is as yet uncertain whether a genetic test to detect a variation in this protein would be beneficial for patients in everyday practice. \"All patients who are at risk should be monitored to see whether or not lifestyle changes or medication have a positive impact on the more standard major risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"</td>\n",

In an often acrimonious debate, acting PM Mariano Rajoy said a Socialist-led coalition would be a threat to Spain's national interests. Another vote will be held on Friday. If that vote is also unsuccessful, parliament will have a further two months to choose a government. If it is unable to do, fresh elections will be held on 26 June. Blame game begins in earnest Strain of Sanchez's bid to rule Kiss that showed real political passion Mr Sanchez needed an absolute majority in Wednesday's confidence vote but lost, with 219 votes against, 130 in favour and one abstention in the 350-seat lower house. Mr Rajoy - leader of the incumbent conservative Popular Party (PP) - called Mr Sanchez a \"fictitious, unreal candidate\". He told Mr Sanchez the PP's 122 deputies would vote against him \"because you plan to eliminate what was achieved in Spain throughout these past four years which prevented this country from needing a bailout, created jobs, improved its competitiveness and caused it to grow economically\".

He said a Socialist-led government would enact a series of progressive measures such as a minimum wage increase and a gender wage-gap law.

The Popular Party gained most votes in the 20 December election but Mr Rajoy was unable to secure enough backing to form a government.

       "      <td>The London borough is the UK local authority with the highest rate of HIV. Local councils and charities warn HIV test guidelines may not be implemented in England because of a lack of funds. New guidance from the National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence aims to increase testing in people with undiagnosed HIV in England. The guidance is published to coincide with World Aids Day. It is estimated that 103,700 people are living with HIV in the UK and 17% of people with the virus are unaware of their infection, so risk unintentionally passing it on to their sexual partners. Part of the new NICE guidance focuses on testing for HIV, which is the responsibility of local authorities, where there are high or extremely high rates of HIV. Two-thirds of late HIV diagnoses occur in these areas. Over one-third of the 152 council areas have high rates. The updated guidance recommends all patients in areas with high and extremely high rates of HIV be offered a test on admission to hospital, if they have not previously been diagnosed with HIV and are undergoing a blood test for another reason. In extremely high rate areas, hospitals should offer the tests even if they are not having blood tests as part of their care. GP surgeries in high and extremely high-rate areas should also offer patients an HIV test on registration. NICE also recommends testing community settings in these high rates areas, such as pharmacies, the voluntary sector and venues where there may be high-risk sexual behaviour. HIV experts have strongly welcomed the new guidance but told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they are concerned the NICE guidance may not be implemented because of a lack of funds. Dr Chloe Orkin, from the British HIV Association, said prevention was simply not \"high\" enough on the government's agenda given pubic health budgets are being cut by nearly 4% a year. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said achieving what NICE was asking was going to be difficult. \"The strain placed on councils by the cuts by central government to public health budgets would make commissioning HIV testing in all surgeries and hospitals in high and extremely high-risk areas an unaffordable burden. \"Despite these limited resources, testing those in high-risk areas must always be a priority. Councils are commissioning HIV testing in a variety of settings.\" But the Department of Health maintained councils had been provided with sufficient funding. Nonetheless, the Elton John Aids Foundation feels councils need help and has offered to fund HIV testing in Lambeth for two years. David Furnish, chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation, said: \"I believe everyone should have an HIV test. We know we can make a difference in Lambeth, but there is no reason why we can't do this in future in other high-rate areas.\" Jennifer Reiter, of Lambeth Council, added: \"We value Elton John Aids Foundation's support and are exploring ways with them to increase access to HIV testing.\" The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays from 09:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Writing in PLOS ONE they say the gene fault may encourage the formation of blood clots - the ultimate cause of most heart attacks and strokes. Scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pinpoint individuals more likely to suffer these conditions. But experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk. Around one in 10 people in the Caucasian population carries this variation of the gene, named PIA2. And researchers from King's College London reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50,000 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date. They found individuals with PIA2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood clot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene. Scientists calculate the gene increases a person's risk of having a stroke by 10-15%. But how significant this increase is depends on an individual's baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking, diet, weight and exercise, the scientists say. And for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70% from this baseline. In a second study published in the same journal, the scientists show PIA2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45. More research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population, they say. About 150,000 people have a stroke in the UK each year and more than 100,000 heart attacks are recorded annually. Both thrombotic strokes (the most common kind) and heart attacks are caused by blockage of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of clots. The faulty gene appears to affect a protein called glycoprotein IIIa - present on platelets, natural clotting cells in the blood. Platelets help trigger the formation of clots to stop bleeding after injury. But scientists say carrying the gene may render them overactive. They caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors, such as high blood pressure and obesity. But developing a genetic test could help predict people at highest risk, allowing doctors to suggest more potent medication or lifestyle changes, they say. Prof Albert Ferro, of King's College London, who led the research, told the BBC: \"We would now need to validate this test and see how useful it is in the clinical world.\" Dr Shamim Quadir, of the Stroke Association, said: \"These latest results are an important step forward in stroke research. \"We hope the findings from this study could lead to many more people who are most at risk of this devastating condition being identified. \"However, if you have a family history of stroke or have any other risk factors, this does not mean the condition is inevitable. Regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking can be important steps to significantly reduce your stroke risk.\" Prof Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: \"It is as yet uncertain whether a genetic test to detect a variation in this protein would be beneficial for patients in everyday practice. \"All patients who are at risk should be monitored to see whether or not lifestyle changes or medication have a positive impact on the more standard major risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"</td>\n",

    "# Preparing XSUM Data\n",
    "Before we can put the text into a model we need to convert it into a format that the transformer can understand. Encoders and decoders only understand numerical values; we need to tokenize each word and then convert the tokens into numerical values. The tokenization transformer splits text into tokens and then adds special tokens if expected based on pretraining. The tokenizer then matches each token to unique id in vocabulary of tokenizer which has a corresponding vector of numerical values. These vectors contain the contextualized value of a word. For example, the vector representation of the word \"to\" isnt just \"to\", it also takes into account the words around it which are called context (right and left context). To continue this example, \"Welcome to NYC\" is a sentence that has the word \"to\". For the word \"to\" the left context is \"Welcome\" and the right context is \"NYC\". The output is based on these contexts; this is how the value is a contextualized vector thanks to self-attention mechanism. We can do all of this using the AutoTokenizer.from_pretarined method to ensure that we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use (facebook/bart-large-cnn); however, we will specifically reference the BartTokenizer in our checkpoint, tokenizer, and model to ensure all aspects of our model were trained using the same methodologies so we can avoid unexpected summaries"

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ofsted visited six Schools Partnership Trust (SPTA) academies as part of routine inspections and found five were not offering good quality education. One school retained its \"inadequate\" rating by Ofsted. SPTA accepted improvement was needed but said there was \"ample evidence\" it was \"an effective\" academy sponsor. The judgements are significant because putting poor performing schools under the leadership of non-profit-making academy trusts or sponsors is the government's key engine of school improvement. Sir Paul Edwards, chief executive of SPTA - which runs 44 schools in the Yorkshire and Humber area, has also worked as a government adviser in the Department for Education's academy and free school programme. 'Ill-prepared' England's education inspectorate is not allowed to inspect academy chains in the same way as it inspects local education authorities. Ofsted inspected the six schools over a 10-day period in June and sought further information on how SPTA has been performing on school improvement. It said concerns had been raised about how well it was performing. Four of the academies still required improvement, Ofsted said, although two of these had begun to improve. One academy remained inadequate, but a sixth had improved to \"good\" from its previous rating of \"satisfactory\". The inspections also highlighted key weaknesses in the schools, such as inconsistent teaching that does not challenge pupils enough and low standards at the end of primary school. This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said. It also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality. But inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff. In a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable. \"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement. \"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\" An SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system. \"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said. \"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership. \"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\" SPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.</td>\n",

    "To score our machine generated summaries against professional human written ones, we compute the cosine similarities between embeddings to measure the semantic similaritiy between two texts. The comparisons we will be marking include: human summary to machine summary, human summary to original document, and machine summary to original document. The maximum length in each machine summary is contextually related to the human summary (but not by the number of words, rather characters in the summary). When words were selected the summary did not perform well and only provided the first words of every article. This makes sense because BART's pretraining likely influenced it's methodology to recognize that the start of text often contains valuable summarization inforamtion. Instead, we wanted to provide a contextual number related to the summary using the maximum length as the number of characters in the human summary rather than an arbitrary number. It is important to note that the model config for BART shows the minimum_length for tokens in a sequence is 56"

       " 'Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There\\'s a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.']"

       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don\\'t know what\\'s what: you might be in the driver\\'s seat but your hands aren\\'t on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there\\'s a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury\\'s crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman\\'s stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it\\'s anyone\\'s guess as to when - if ever - he\\'ll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I\\'m drinking, I\\'m drinking until I can\\'t stand up. If I\\'m going out for Chinese, I\\'m going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I\\'m eating cake, I\\'m eating the whole cake. I don\\'t know what you\\'d call me. An idiot, maybe?\" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won\\'t be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury\\'s camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn\\'t train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard\\'s victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas\\'s upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn\\'t fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn\\'t been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury\\'s sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury\\'s controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury\\'s camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury\\'s performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what\\'s happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury\\'s camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday\\'s Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it\\'s in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury\\'s Traveller heritage doesn\\'t come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. \"I know Tyson personally and he\\'s a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury\\'s fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\" Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation\\'s mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua\\'s brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC\\'s general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\". There was also Fury\\'s alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn\\'t be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing\\'s image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn\\'t voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can\\'t have a belt held hostage.\" One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. \"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton\\'s grim assessment. \"He doesn\\'t like boxing and finds the training hard. It\\'s not looking good. \"But I was in a dark place, didn\\'t care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\" Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.']"

       " 'The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers\\' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: \"Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. \"This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. \"The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. \"On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. \"Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. \"Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.\"']"

       " \"Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

The Northern Irishman would not be drawn on whether this was a step on the way to a potential domestic treble.\",\n",
       " '\"I\\'m really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football,\" said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit. \"I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity. \"The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff.\" This will be Rodgers\\' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month. \"It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect,\" he recalled. \"Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we\\'ll be looking to have a similar performance. \"We\\'ll be prepared and focused. We know it\\'s going to be a tough game.
