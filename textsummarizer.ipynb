    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization is a common problem in the 21st century as the world has become increasingly driven by data. Summarization of data can be very useful to  quickly determine if something is relevant or whether it's worth reading. Another use case could could be to store summaries of articles it in the backend to run downstream taks on. It could also be useful to understand the semantic integrity to indicate quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this topic, we will leverage the extreme summarization dataset (XSUM) which consists of BBC articles accompanying single sentence summaries. Each article is prefaced with an introductory sentence (which is a summary) that is professionally written, typically by the author of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize articles, we will use an encoder-decoder transformer (sequence-to-sequence) which combines  decoders and encoders because we need to perform both input and output tasks: taking in text and then generating a summary. We selected this type of transformer because the encoder accepts inputs (text) and computes a high level representation of those inputs  which are then passed to the decoder to generate a prediction output (summary). This has advantages over using a standalone encoder like BERT/ALBERT/ELECTRA/RoBERTA/DistilBERT to name a few because  encoders are pre-trained by filling randomly masked words in sentences and therefore are better suited for output tasks. Using a standalone decoder like gpt2 would also not be optimal because decoders are trained to guess the next word in a sequence (left or right context aka does not have context on one side of the sequence) and therefore are better suited at generating text but not necessarily taking in text because of the hidden context limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our scoring will compare the output of the BART encoder-decoder model to the professionally written summaries in the XSUM dataset to see how semantically similar a machine generated summary is to a professional one as well as to their source articles. Our scoring methodology will be focused on semantic textual similarity and computed using the cosine similarity between the professional human written summary and the machine generated one. "

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",

       "      <td>She stressed that to kill a police officer was to attack the fundamental basis of our society. But Mrs May also said police officers must end frivolous accident claims and focus on raising public trust. Earlier the Police Federation urged her not to base legislation changes on the behaviour of a handful of officers. During her address, Mrs May said suing someone after slipping on their property was not the sort of attitude officers should exhibit. Her comments come after it emerged recently that one police officer, PC Kelly Jones, had taken legal action after tripping on a kerb at a Norfolk petrol station in August. Mrs May also revealed plans to allow police to take over shoplifting prosecutions where goods taken were worth less than Â£200. Unveiling plans for a change in legislation at the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth, Mrs May announced the government proposal that the minimum term for killing an officer should be increased to life without parole. The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years. By Danny ShawBBC home affairs correspondent Theresa Mays whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by rank-and-file officers - but its unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the governments programme of cuts and reforms to the service. High on their list of concerns is an idea, currently the subject of negotiation, which would allow chief constables to make police compulsorily redundant. Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they dont like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights thered be nothing police could do about it. A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer. The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea. The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was a particularly appalling crime. We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us, she said. And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent. She added: We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences. In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated. The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder. A spokesman said: Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council. But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in. The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison. There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. The home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last years conference after she told officers to stop pretending they were being singled out and would have to make their share of public spending cuts. Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs Mays sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the governments programme of cuts and reforms. Speaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers. The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers. On Tuesday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad.</td>\n",

The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years. By Danny ShawBBC home affairs correspondent Theresa Mays whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by rank-and-file officers - but its unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the governments programme of cuts and reforms to the service.

Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they dont like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights thered be nothing police could do about it. A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer. The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea. The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was a particularly appalling crime. We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us, she said. And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent. She added: We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences. In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated. The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder. A spokesman said: Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council. But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in. The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison. There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe.

    "Before we can put the text into a model we need to convert it into a format that the transformer can understand. Encoders and decoders only understand numerical values; we need to tokenize each word and then convert the tokens into numerical values. The tokenization transformer splits text into tokens and then adds special tokens if expected based on pretraining. The tokenizer then matches each token to unique id in vocabulary of tokenizer which has a corresponding vector of numerical values. These vectors contain the contextualized value of a word. For example, the vector representation of the word \"to\" isnt just \"to\", it also takes into account the words around it which are called context (right and left context). To continue this example, \"Welcome to NYC\" is a sentence that has the word \"to\". For the word \"to\" the left context is \"Welcome\" and the right context is \"NYC\". The output is based on these contexts; this is how the value is a contextualized vector thanks to self-attention mechanism. We can do all of this using the AutoTokenizer.from_pretarined method to ensure that we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use (facebook/bart-large-cnn); however, we will specifically reference the BartTokenizer in our checkpoint, tokenizer, and model to ensure all aspects of our model were trained using the same methodologies so we can avoid unexpected summaries"

In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the partys wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future, she said.

       "      <td>As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws. Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europes largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger. Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development. Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation.</td>\n",

I always said if I play where I did for my last club I could get goals but I havent really had that chance since I came here, he told Rangers website. Hopefully I can play in a bit more of an attacking position this season and get some more goals in the league. Midfielder Windass, playing in an advanced role, scored 17 goals for Accrington in season 2015/16 before moving to Rangers in the summer of 2016. He has scored in closed door friendly matches this summer and was delighted to hit the target in front of a health crowd as the Ibrox side rounded off their pre-season with a win against Championship outfit Wednesday. I was pleased to get a goal - it has been a long time since I scored my last one, he added. Obviously it is only a friendly so it doesnt mean that much but its nice to get off the mark. I dont think I had a point to prove this pre-season. I have no idea how the manager is thinking but I can only keep playing how I have been playing. I have scored a few goals in pre-season so hopefully that is enough to get in the team. Following their shock Europa League exit at the hands of Luxembourg side Progres Niederkorn, Rangers have drawn 1-1 with Marseille, beaten Watford 2-1 and saw off Sheffield Wednesday in friendly matches. With their season kicking off away to Motherwell on 6 August, Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha believes his new-look side are clicking into gear. The last three games, Marseille, Watford and today Sheffield Wednesday, were fantastic for us to get our cohesion, to get our ideas, to add everything in and get our confidence and our belief, the Portuguese told the Rangers website. The boys have been making a fantastic effort in order to keep focused and look forward, and today they had their bonus. We knew since the very beginning we are not the worst team in the world and we are not the best one, but we need to keep this focus and this approach to the game.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws. Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europes largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger. Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development. Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation.</td>\n",

I was pleased to get a goal - it has been a long time since I scored my last one, he added. Obviously it is only a friendly so it doesnt mean that much but its nice to get off the mark. I dont think I had a point to prove this pre-season. I have no idea how the manager is thinking but I can only keep playing how I have been playing. I have scored a few goals in pre-season so hopefully that is enough to get in the team.

Nominations to become the next leader of the DUP close later on Wednesday. Peter Robinson announced in November that he was standing down as party leader. On Tuesday, Mrs Foster said she was very humbled by the support she has received from party colleagues. Mr Wilson thought long and hard about his decision and spoke to among others, party colleagues Mrs Foster and Mr Dodds. In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the partys wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future, she said. In a tweet on Monday night, Mr Robinson said he had received a valid nomination from Mrs Foster for the post of DUP leader. Arlenes nomination was submitted with the support of over 75% of those entitled to vote in the electoral college, he added.</td>\n",

In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the partys wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future, she said.

The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws. Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europes largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger. Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development. Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation.</td>\n",

I always said if I play where I did for my last club I could get goals but I havent really had that chance since I came here, he told Rangers website. Hopefully I can play in a bit more of an attacking position this season and get some more goals in the league. Midfielder Windass, playing in an advanced role, scored 17 goals for Accrington in season 2015/16 before moving to Rangers in the summer of 2016. He has scored in closed door friendly matches this summer and was delighted to hit the target in front of a health crowd as the Ibrox side rounded off their pre-season with a win against Championship outfit Wednesday. I was pleased to get a goal - it has been a long time since I scored my last one, he added. Obviously it is only a friendly so it doesnt mean that much but its nice to get off the mark. I dont think I had a point to prove this pre-season. I have no idea how the manager is thinking but I can only keep playing how I have been playing. I have scored a few goals in pre-season so hopefully that is enough to get in the team. Following their shock Europa League exit at the hands of Luxembourg side Progres Niederkorn, Rangers have drawn 1-1 with Marseille, beaten Watford 2-1 and saw off Sheffield Wednesday in friendly matches. With their season kicking off away to Motherwell on 6 August, Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha believes his new-look side are clicking into gear. The last three games, Marseille, Watford and today Sheffield Wednesday, were fantastic for us to get our cohesion, to get our ideas, to add everything in and get our confidence and our belief, the Portuguese told the Rangers website. The boys have been making a fantastic effort in order to keep focused and look forward, and today they had their bonus. We knew since the very beginning we are not the worst team in the world and we are not the best one, but we need to keep this focus and this approach to the game.</td>\n",

As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development. Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation.</td>\n",

Hopefully I can play in a bit more of an attacking position this season and get some more goals in the league.

He has scored in closed door friendly matches this summer and was delighted to hit the target in front of a health crowd as the Ibrox side rounded off their pre-season with a win against Championship outfit Wednesday. I was pleased to get a goal - it has been a long time since I scored my last one, he added. Obviously it is only a friendly so it doesnt mean that much but its nice to get off the mark. I dont think I had a point to prove this pre-season. I have no idea how the manager is thinking but I can only keep playing how I have been playing. I have scored a few goals in pre-season so hopefully that is enough to get in the team. Following their shock Europa League exit at the hands of Luxembourg side Progres Niederkorn, Rangers have drawn 1-1 with Marseille, beaten Watford 2-1 and saw off Sheffield Wednesday in friendly matches. With their season kicking off away to Motherwell on 6 August, Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha believes his new-look side are clicking into gear. The last three games, Marseille, Watford and today Sheffield Wednesday, were fantastic for us to get our cohesion, to get our ideas, to add everything in and get our confidence and our belief, the Portuguese told the Rangers website.

Finance Minister Arlene Foster is the only person so far to declare an interest and has the backing of a majority of the partys most senior elected representatives. Nominations to become the next leader of the DUP close later on Wednesday. Peter Robinson announced in November that he was standing down as party leader. On Tuesday, Mrs Foster said she was very humbled by the support she has received from party colleagues. Mr Wilson thought long and hard about his decision and spoke to among others, party colleagues Mrs Foster and Mr Dodds. In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the partys wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future, she said. In a tweet on Monday night, Mr Robinson said he had received a valid nomination from Mrs Foster for the post of DUP leader. Arlenes nomination was submitted with the support of over 75% of those entitled to vote in the electoral college, he added.</td>\n",

The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws. Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europes largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger. Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process.

However, because the length of the XSUM summaries are so short (hence the name extreme summaries), the model  only provided the first words of every article. This makes sense because BART's pretraining likely influenced it's methodology to recognize that the start of text often contains valuable summarization inforamtion. As a result we opted for a length of 60 words to keep it brief but allow the model to output enough context to be meaningful. The average summaries for our models are outlined below (at ~19 words per human summary)"

       " 'Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was chronic. Theres a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere, he said. It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice. Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds, he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter. Youre put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and its difficult, its difficult to get away from it. Its like every man for himself, theres nothing. Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. You feel safe, you got hot food, youve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. Its a constructive, helpful atmosphere, he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they havent got accommodation and havent got provision, he said. I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I dont delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we cant. But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen. A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.']"

       " 'Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years. The repeated claims from Furys camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached',\n",
       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you dont know whats what: you might be in the drivers seat but your hands arent on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and theres a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Furys crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishmans stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, its anyones guess as to when - if ever - hell have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as an all-action man in anything I do. If Im drinking, Im drinking until I cant stand up. If Im going out for Chinese, Im going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If Im eating cake, Im eating the whole cake. I dont know what youd call me. An idiot, maybe? Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly wont be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Furys camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didnt train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willards victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglass upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didnt fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasnt been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a witch hunt against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Furys sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Furys controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Furys camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Furys performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget whats happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Furys camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations. How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sundays Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If its in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Furys Traveller heritage doesnt come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. I know Tyson personally and hes a really nice guy, says Ricky Hatton, Furys fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous. Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federations mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshuas brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofCs general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, cocaine is against the law of the land. There was also Furys alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldnt be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxings image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadnt voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: We cant have a belt held hostage. One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him, was Hattons grim assessment. He doesnt like boxing and finds the training hard. Its not looking good. But I was in a dark place, didnt care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same. Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.']"

       " 'The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.']"

       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at Londons O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murrays straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queens Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murrays aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queens, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murrays hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murrays chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadals knees, Djokovics blues and Wawrinkas unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then theres Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect, he recalled. Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but well be looking to have a similar performance. Well be prepared and focused. We know its going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time. Rodgers is also aware Celtics visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat. The last experience there wasnt so good for Celtic, he said. But its a different team with a different mentality and well look to take that mentality into the game.

Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble. Its very, very difficult to achieve, he said. Theres been great managers here in the past that havent achieved that. But its the first competition where weve a chance to win a trophy and Ive always said that its a priority for us because its the first one. Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which weve done, and then look to get to the League Cup final. Unless you can do that then you dont have the chance to win the trophies.']"

    "We can see that the machine model had higher cosine similarity to the original article 70% of the time compared to the human article. However, this may be influenced by the fact that the length of the machine summary was about 3x the size of the average human summary. The argument early_stopping=True/False did not appear to have any real affect on cosine-similarity at the max length size of 60 (we compared the 10 models with and without and obtained similar results). The pretrained transformers do provide relevant summaries when reviewing these articles so it appears there is a definite use case for providing news article snippits in products like Bloomberg First Word or other content editors. 20% of the models showed the machine vs human summaries having relatively equivalent cosine similarities. It appears that human summaries are shorter and more semantically similar to articles than machine summaries for articles about sports and athletes. This may be an area that huggingface could focus on pretraining new pipelines, transformers, and models in the future to expand their use cases."
